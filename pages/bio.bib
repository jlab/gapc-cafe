  abstract = {Background: Many bioinformatics tools for RNA secondary structure analysis are based on a thermodynamic
model of RNA folding. They predict a single, “optimal” structure by free energy minimization, they enumerate near-
optimal structures, they compute base pair probabilities and dot plots, representative structures of different
abstract shapes, or Boltzmann probabilities of structures and shapes. Although all programs refer to the same
physical model, they implement it with considerable variation for different tasks, and little is known about the
effects of heuristic assumptions and model simplifications used by the programs on the outcome of the analysis.

Results: We extract four different models of the thermodynamic folding space which underlie the programs
RNAFOLD, RNASHAPES, and RNASUBOPT. Their differences lie within the details of the energy model and the
granularity of the folding space. We implement probabilistic shape analysis for all models, and introduce the shape
probability shift as a robust measure of model similarity. Using four data sets derived from experimentally solved
structures, we provide a quantitative evaluation of the model differences.

  title = {{Shape based indexing for faster search of {RNA} family databases}},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {131},
  abstract = {Background: Most non-coding RNA families exert their function by means
        of a conserved, common secondary structure. The Rfam data base contains
        more than five hundred structurally annotated RNA families. Unfortunately,
        searching for new family members using covariance models (CMs) is
        very time consuming. Filtering approaches that use the sequence conservation
        to reduce the number of CM searches, are fast, but it is unknown
        to which sacrifice.

Results: We present a new filtering approach,
        which exploits the family specific secondary structure and significantly
        reduces the number of CM searches. The filter eliminates approximately
        85\% of the queries and discards only 2.6\% true positives when evaluating
        Rfam against itself. First results also capture previously undetected
        non-coding RNAs in a recent human RNAz screen.

Conclusion: The RNA
        shape index filter (RNAsifter) is based on the following rationale:
        An RNA family is characterised by structure, much more succinctly
        than by sequence content. Structures of individual family members,
        which naturally have different length and sequence composition, may
        exhibit structural variation in detail, but overall, they have a
        common shape in a more abstract sense. Given a fixed release of the
        Rfam data base, we can compute these abstract shapes for all families.
        This is called a shape index. If a query sequence belongs to a certain
        family, it must be able to fold into the family shape with reasonable
        free energy. Therefore, rather than matching the query against all
        families in the data base, we can first (and quickly) compute its
        feasible shape(s), and use the shape index to access only those families
        where a good match is possible due to a common shape with the query.},

small regulatory RNAs, we present Locomotif — a new approach for
locating RNA motifs that goes beyond the previous ones in three
ways: (1) motif search is based on efficient dynamic programming
algorithms, incorporating the established thermodynamic model of
RNA secondary structure formation. (2) motifs are described
graphically, using a Java-based editor, and search algorithms are
derived from the graphics in a fully automatic way. The editor allows
us to draw secondary structures, annotated with size and sequence
information. They closely resemble the established, but informal way
in which RNA motifs are communicated in the literature. Thus, the
learning effort for Locomotif users is minimal. (3) Locomotif employs
a client-server approach. Motifs are designed by the user locally.
Search programs are generated and compiled on a bioinformatics
server. They are made available both for execution on the server,
and for download as C source code plus an appropriate makefile.

mRNAs. Although a large number of animal miRNAs has been defined, only a few targets are known. In contrast to plant
miRNAs, which usually bind nearly perfectly to their targets, animal miRNAs bind less tightly, with a few nucleotides being
unbound, thus producing more complex secondary structures of miRNA/target duplexes. Here, we present a program, RNA-
hybrid, that predicts multiple potential binding sites of miRNAs in large target RNAs. In general, the program finds the
energetically most favorable hybridization sites of a small RNA in a large RNA. Intramolecular hybridizations, that is, base
pairings between target nucleotides or between miRNA nucleotides are not allowed. For large targets, the time complexity of
the algorithm is linear in the target length, allowing many long targets to be searched in a short time. Statistical significance of
predicted targets is assessed with an extreme value statistics of length normalized minimum free energies, a Poisson approximation of multiple binding sites, and the calculation of effective numbers of orthologous targets in comparative studies of
multiple organisms. We applied our method to the prediction of Drosophila miRNA targets in 3'UTRs and coding sequence.

  abstract = {Background: Soon after the first algorithms for RNA folding became available, it was recognised
that the prediction of only one energetically optimal structure is insufficient to achieve reliable
results. An in-depth analysis of the folding space as a whole appeared necessary to deduce the
structural properties of a given RNA molecule reliably. Folding space analysis comprises various
methods such as suboptimal folding, computation of base pair probabilities, sampling procedures
and abstract shape analysis. Common to many approaches is the idea of partitioning the folding
space into classes of structures, for which certain properties can be derived.

Results: In this paper we extend the approach of abstract shape analysis. We show how to
compute the accumulated probabilities of all structures that share the same shape. While this
implies a complete (non-heuristic) analysis of the folding space, the computational effort depends
only on the size of the shape space, which is much smaller. This approach has been integrated into
the tool RNAshapes, and we apply it to various RNAs.

Conclusion: Analyses of conformational switches show the existence of two shapes with
probabilities approximately 2/3
vs. 1/3, whereas the analysis of a microRNA precursor reveals one
shape with a probability near to 1.0. Furthermore, it is shown that a shape can outperform an
energetically more favourable one by achieving a higher probability. From these results, and the fact
that we use a complete and exact analysis of the folding space, we conclude that this approach
opens up new and promising routes for investigating and understanding RNA secondary structure.

The general problem of RNA secondary structure prediction under the widely used thermodynamic model is known to be NP-complete when the structures considered include arbitrary pseudoknots. For restricted classes of pseudoknots, several polynomial time algorithms have been designed, where the O(n^6)time and O(n^4) space algorithm by Rivas and Eddy is currently the best available program.

Results:
We introduce the class of canonical simple recursive pseudoknots and present an algorithm that requires O(n^4) time and O(n^2) space to predict the energetically optimal structure of an RNA sequence, possible containing such pseudoknots. Evaluation against a large collection of known pseudoknotted structures shows the adequacy of the canonization approach and our algorithm.

Conclusions:
RNA pseudoknots of medium size can now be predicted reliably as well as efficiently by the new algorithm.}

  abstract = {The function of a non-protein-coding RNA is often determined by its structure. Since experimental determination of RNA structure is time-consuming and expensive, its computational prediction is of great interest, and efficient solutions based on thermodynamic parameters are known. Frequently, however, the predicted minimum free energy structures are not the native ones, leading to the necessity of generating suboptimal solutions. While this can be accomplished by a number of programs, the user is often confronted with large outputs of similar structures, although he or she is interested in structures with more fundamental differences, or, in other words, with different abstract shapes. Here, we formalize the concept of abstract shapes and introduce their efficient computation. Each shape of an RNA molecule comprises a class of similar structures and has a representative structure of minimal free energy within the class. Shape analysis is implemented in the program RNAshapes. We applied RNAshapes to the prediction of optimal and suboptimal abstract shapes of several RNAs. For a given energy range, the number of shapes is considerably smaller than the number of structures, and in all cases, the native structures were among the top shape representatives. This demonstrates that the researcher can quickly focus on the structures of interest, without processing up to thousands of near-optimal solutions. We complement this study with a large-scale analysis of the growth behaviour of structure and shape spaces. RNAshapes is available for download and as an online version on the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server.}

We demonstrate that by the use of so-called canonical pattern descriptions, the expected number of hits on a sequence of length n can be
computed a priori, using the pattern matcher itself. This provides a systematic way to calibrate the specificity of pattern matching algorithms.
The technique is exemplified by examples using IRE and SECIS elements.

        is to construct a kissing hairpin motif from an overlay of two simple

        satisfy Bellman's Principle of Optimality, and the kissing hairpin
        cannot simply be built from optimal pseudoknots. Our strategies have
        time/space complexities of $O(n^4) / O(n^2)$, $O(n^4) / O(n^3)$,

  pages = {632-639},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {Motivation: Abstract shape analysis allows efficient computation of
        a representative sample of low-energy foldings of an RNA molecule.
        More comprehensive information is obtained by computing shape probabilities,
        accumulating the Boltzmann probabilities of all structures within
        each abstract shape. Such information is superior to free energies
        because it is independent of sequence length and base composition.
        However, up to this point, computation of shape probabilities evaluates
        all shapes simultaneously and comes with a computation cost which
        is exponential in the length of the sequence. Results: We device
        an approach called RapidShapes that computes the shapes above a specified
        probability threshold T by generating a list of promising shapes
        and constructing specialized folding programs for each shape to compute
        its share of Boltzmann probability. This aims at a heuristic improvement
        of runtime, while still computing exact probability values. Conclusion:
        Evaluating this approach and several substrategies, we find that
        only a small proportion of shapes have to be actually computed. For
        an RNA sequence of length 400, this leads, depending on the threshold,
        to a 10-138 fold speed-up compared with the previous complete method.
        Thus, probabilistic shape analysis has become feasible in medium-scale
        applications, such as the screening of RNA transcripts in a bacterial
        genome.},
